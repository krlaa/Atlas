What is data mining and does data mining threaten personal privacy? How? Are there ethical implications of data mining?

2. What “six ways” might data mining raise privacy issues more than traditional retrieval from the Internet according to Tavini (1999). What are your thoughts?  

3. As stated in the conclusion of the article, “data mining is incompatible with both the Purpose Specification and Use Limitation Principles of the Fair Information Practices, an international set of guidelines codified in the OECD, as well as with the spirit of the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974.” (Tavani, 1999, pg. 144)  Explain why the author came to this conclusion. What are your thoughts about this statement?
