Topic - Growth of Functions and complexity/ Upper and lower bound

## Notes 
---
- **Lower bound** is the <= best case for an algorithm
- **Upper bound** is the >= worst case for an algorithm
-  To calculate use the upper and lower bound use the constants attached to N to calculate
	-  3N^2 + 10N +17 = 30N^2 because 3\*10 then attach to the higher notation


### Asymptotic Notation 
Example:
**T(N)=2N3<sup>2</sup>+N+9** 
 
 - O notation - provides growth rate of algorithms upper bound
	 - positive constant *c* exists where T(N) <= *c* \* f(N)
 - Ω notation - provides growth rate of algorithms lower 
	 - A positive constant c exists such that, for all N ≥ 1, T(N)>=*c* \* f(N).
 - Θ notation - provides growth rate that is both upper and lower bound
	 - O and Ω are the same

O notation c = 12
