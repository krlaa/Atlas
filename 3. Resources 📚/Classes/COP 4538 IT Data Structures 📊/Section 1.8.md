Topic - Growth of Functions and complexity/ Upper and lower bound

## Notes 
---
- **Lower bound** is the <= best case for an algorithm
- **Upper bound** is the >= worst case for an algorithm
-  To calculate use the upper and lower bound use the constants attached to N to calculate
	-  3N^2 + 10N +17 = 30N^2 because 3\*10 then attach to the higher notation
	-   
 T(N)=2N^2+N+9.
