numbers = (25, 36, 76, 71, 49, 75, 96, 64)
Partition(numbers, 2, 7) is called.
The midpoint is 2 + (7 - 2)/2 = 2 + 2 = 4, so the pivot is numbers[4], which is 49.
 
Since 76 is greater than the pivot and 49 is equal to the pivot, the partitioning algorithm swaps 76 and 49 to place 49 in the low partition and 76 in the high partition.
numbers is now: (25, 36, 49, 71, 76, 75, 96, 64)
 
The low partition has elements from index 2 to index 2: (49).
The high partition has elements from index 3 to index 7: (71, 76, 75, 96, 64).
After Partition(numbers, 2, 7) completes, numbers is (25, 36, 49, 71, 76, 75, 96, 64).

If the pivot is always chosen to divide the elements into two equal parts, the number of partitioning levels for N elements is log2 N, so log2 8 = 3 levels. Â  If the pivot is always chosen to be the smallest element, the number of partitioning levels for N elements is N - 1, so 8 - 1 = 7 levels.
