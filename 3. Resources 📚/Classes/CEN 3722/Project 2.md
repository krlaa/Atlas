# Part 1

For this part I have decided to choose the game Temple Run. This game was very popular in 2011 

## Virtual Reality:
1. Research and Considerations
	-  The main consideration to take note of is the interaction of the virtual environment. Since Temple Run involves jumping and moving side to side the best way to tackle this problem is to incorporate a joystick in the game. The joy stick will act as the controls for moving side to side. For the jumping aspect of the game to make it more interactive there will be a gyro sensor in either the head set or the joystick to sense when the player goes up and down.
2.  Hypothetical Scenario
	- For VR Temple Run the idea is fairly straightforward, the player puts on the VR headset and picks up the joystick. The joystick would be similar in design to the PlayStation Move Navigation Controller where there is two buttons and the analog stick. The buttons only have purpose in the game to select different modes in the menu screen as well as pausing the and continue progression in the game. After a mode (easy, medium, hard) is selected then the game will begin in a first person point of view where the character is constantly running until they get hit by an obstacle.
3. Design Issues
	- I think the biggest design issue is accessibility. This is purely based on the jump mechanic, if there is not enough space or the player cannot physically jump then the game wouldn't be accessible. This needs to be fixed by either adding different mechanics or an extra button on the handheld controller. 
4. Pros and Cons
	- Pros:
		- Immersive experience
		- physical benefit (from jumping)
	- Cons:
		- Not portable
		- Space consuming
		- Motion sickness

## Wearable
1. Research and Considerations
	- For wearable design in the scope of the game Temple Run the biggest consideration is the use of different technologies. For this specific scenario, you would have to consider which sensor or gadget could control the movement of the player. 
2.  Hypothetical Scenario
	- For this hypothetical scenario the wearable device that will be needed to play the game is Google Glass or another augmented reality eye-wear. The player would put on the glasses and be presented with a menu screen very similar to the one mention the VR section. The controls for the menu and pause functionality would be on the glasses themselves. For player movement this is where the creativity of the designer can sprout different possibilities. With a gyro sensor players actually jumping could be inputted into the game as a jump. For side to side movement this could be implemented with a separate gadget, either handheld like the controller mentioned in the VR section or the phone could be used as the controller.
3. Design Issues
	- As aforementioned interaction of menus and intractable items in the game will be done through the wearable device controls. This wearable approach also limits the option of multiplayer. Rules for this rendition of the game would be entirely identical to the mobile game. However since it is on a different platform maybe there could be some leeway on what register as a collision so that players don't constantly get frustrated that they didn't jump fast enough. 
4. Pros and Cons
	- Pros:
		- portable
		- immersive experience
		- Less motion sickness because not completed separated from reality
	- Cons:
		- Expensive
		- Space consuming
		- Potential extra hardware.






## Multimodal
1. Research and Considerations
	- Temple Run through the concept of multimodal interface is a game involving the player physically going through a maze like course with turns and obstacles. A key design consideration is
