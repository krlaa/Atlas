## Notes
---
- training data don't have that much bikes so its harder for a car to detect
- also hard because there is a wider variety of bikes in all shapes and sizes
- slowly gaining attention in lower level autonomous vehicles for automatic braking systems
- Bikes are unpredictable since they can take sharp turns and such.
