## Notes
---
##### Benefits of autonomous vehicles:
 - improve traffic, hive infrastructure
 - lower pollution
 - better for aging populations
 
---
- can be difficult for system to operate when bad weather or inaccurate maps
- potential to be hacked because it needs wireless spectrum to talk to traffic signals and potentially other cars 
- Another problem is the ethical dilemma of testing these cars on actual roads
- Many countries have restrictions on maps or policy restrictions on use of data. 
- Who owns liability when an accident involving a autonomous car happens? The car or the driver?
