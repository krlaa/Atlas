1. The journal article,[[Informational privacy, data mining and the Internet]] ([Tavani, H.T., 1999](https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1010063528863.pdf)),  defines the term data mining and explains how data mining could be a threat to personal privacy. What is data mining and does data mining threaten personal privacy? How? Are there ethical implications of data mining?

2. What “six ways” might data mining raise privacy issues more than traditional retrieval from the Internet according to Tavini (1999). What are your thoughts?  

3. As stated in the conclusion of the article, “data mining is incompatible with both the Purpose Specification and Use Limitation Principles of the Fair Information Practices, an international set of guidelines codified in the OECD, as well as with the spirit of the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974.” (Tavani, 1999, pg. 144)  Explain why the author came to this conclusion. What are your thoughts about this statement?


1. Data mining is digging below the surface of a system, person or topic with the help of advance technologies and methods alike. Data mining threatens personal privacy in the sense that it doesn't give a concrete answer of whether information is sold or not. The ehtical implication of data mining is whether or not if it his helping you or hurting you. While companies may know more about you and can tailor their services and products around that information, however you still do have to give up that information causing a dilemma
2.   
	1. implicit patterns can be found with data mining process
	2. single database vs multiple databases
	3. open ended queries to find info on relationships and associations 
	4. predictable information vs unpredictable information about person 
	5. Public nature v private nature of information (whats available to other people).
	6. new groups based on patterns of information.

My thoughts are that the process of data mining can take multiple avenues. The third technique in particular caught my eye as relationships between others can tell a lot about you. So in order to find this information open ended queries can be simply used to figure you out as a person.

3. The author came to this conclusion because they don't see data mining as an ethical practice. It is essentially a breach of privacy, however if the process was better handed then there wouldn't be as much problems as there would be on regular days.
