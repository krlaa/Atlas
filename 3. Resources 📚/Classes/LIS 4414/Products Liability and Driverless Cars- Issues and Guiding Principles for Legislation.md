## Notes
---
- Liability issues are outweighed by the safety that autonomous vehicles brings
- Automation has been in the works since 1958 with the rise of auto-pilot/cruise control. ABS, electronic stability control(ESC), automated parking
- 2013 NHTSA made a classification system for vehicles from 0(no automation) - 10(full automation)

##### Liability Law
- **Tort law** is civil wrongs
	- Negligence
- **Contract** law is when warranties are voided by either party
	- If the seller said that the product will have a certain degree of quality but then it cause the buyer harm the seller could be liable for breach of contract
- **Manufacturing defects** - when something in the manufacturing process goes wrong and client or is injured in accident involving that vehicle than the manufacturer would be found liable.
- **Design defects** - the warning system did not warn me fast enough* this example can be refuted by 2 factors by the manufacturer:
	1. They did provide info
	2. Adding more expensive sensors would increase computation time canceling out the whole purpose 

- **Failure to warn** - Manufactures didn't give adequate explanation of the risks.
