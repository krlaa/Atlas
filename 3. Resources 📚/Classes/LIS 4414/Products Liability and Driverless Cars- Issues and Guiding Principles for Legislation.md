[Article Link ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/products-liability-and-driverless-cars-issues-and-guiding-principles-for-legislation/)


## Notes
---
- Liability issues are outweighed by the safety that autonomous vehicles brings
- Automation has been in the works since 1958 with the rise of auto-pilot/cruise control. ABS, electronic stability control(ESC), automated parking
- 2013 NHTSA made a classification system for vehicles from 0(no automation) - 10(full automation)

##### Liability Law
- **Tort law** is civil wrongs
	- Negligence
- **Contract** law is when warranties are voided by either party
	- If the seller said that the product will have a certain degree of quality but then it cause the buyer harm the seller could be liable for breach of contract
- **Manufacturing defects** - when something in the manufacturing process goes wrong and client or is injured in accident involving that vehicle than the manufacturer would be found liable.
- **Design defects** - the warning system did not warn me fast enough* this example can be refuted by 2 factors by the manufacturer:
	1. They did provide info
	2. Adding more expensive sensors would increase computation time canceling out the whole purpose 
	&nbsp
	&nbsp
	&nbsp
	
	- Uses risk utility tests to determine if the manufacturer is liable

- **Failure to warn** - Manufactures didn't give adequate explanation of the risks.
	- post sale warnings/ warnings - can come in the form of software/firmware upgrades
- **Misrepresentation** - says one thing but in actuality only partially does as what was advertised. 
	- Several types of misrepresentation 
		- Fraudulent - on on purpose
		- Negligent - should've have known
- **Breach of Warranty** - divided in to two parts
	- Express warranty - shows or advertises that product does one thing but doesn't do it well enough
	- implied warranty

- **Solving liability issues about autonomous vehicles should not be a prerequisite**
- **Liability law is adaptive to new technologies**
- **Congress should not enforce a one shoe fits all remedy for autonomous vehicle liability**
- **Third party modifications should be enough grounds for manufacturers to not be liable for "defects"**
- **Safety standards will be needed and they need to have liability implications**
- **Liability for autonomous commercial motor vehicles should be addressed federally **
