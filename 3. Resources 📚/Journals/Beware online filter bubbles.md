## Notes
---
- internet is moving to a place where it showing us what it thinks what we want to see rather than what we actually want to see
- all this personalized algorithms cause a filter bubble
- In order for algorithms to be effective in this day and age we need them to be open and transparent, we should be able to choose the filters etc. We also need to be able to see opposing views because when we don't we feed what is called confirmation bias.
