## Notes
---
1. Developers should be aware that biases can happen
2. Find out and fix the bias
3. Prepare to be accountable for potential biases made by algorithms
4. Explain the choices the algorithm made and why it made them
5. Explain the process of collecting training data and explanation of trying to find potential bias
6. Keep records for audit
7. Validate models and test repeatedly
