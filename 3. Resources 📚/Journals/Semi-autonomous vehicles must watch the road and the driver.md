## Notes
---
Tesla doesn't produce an autonomous vehicle immediately  because then drives would not be aware of the limitations and would put blind faith into the product
- instead sends out incrementally to essentially "teach" drivers. 
- MIT found that salesmen don't know how safety features work so it sometimes causes miscommunication
