### Ingredients 
- 1/4 cup of soy sauce
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1 clove of garlic
- 5 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 1/4 cup cold water

### Steps
1. Lay out ingredients
2. Mix the water and cornstarch and mix until starch is dissolved
3. Add all the ingredients into the sauce pan or pan and then once it comes to a simmer set mental timer for 5 minutes
4. After 5 minutes add the cornstarch mix

### Thoughts
- Use granulated white sugar if no brown sugar, I think using brown sugar cubes caused it to be a little sour because it was burning at the bottom
- wait till almost ready then mix the cornstarch otherwise it wont be mixed
- maybe add a little more water
- Don't put in random container should be a bottle to keep it from coagulating.
- Look into how to prevent it from [[coagulating sauces]]
- Next look into clear soup like the one we had at Token Ramen
